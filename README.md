## FAKE NEWS DETECTION


### ABSTRACT

The spread of fake news is a major concern in today's digital world. This project aims to build a machine learning model to classify news articles as fake or real using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The approach involves text preprocessing, feature extraction using TF-IDF, and training a NaÃ¯ve Bayes classifier to make predictions. The model's performance is evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrix, and ROC curve.



### OVERVIEW

 This project processes and classifies news articles based on their authenticity. The steps include:

- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing â€“ Removing noise, stopwords, and formatting text.
- Feature Extraction â€“ Applying TF-IDF vectorization with bigrams to convert text into numerical form.
- Model Training â€“ Using Multinomial NaÃ¯ve Bayes for text classification.
- Evaluation â€“ Analyzing classification metrics, feature importance, and visualizations.
- Prediction â€“ Implementing a function to classify new text as fake or real.


### Project Goals

- Develop a machine learning model to detect fake news.
- Improve classification accuracy using TF-IDF and NaÃ¯ve Bayes.
- Analyze the most important features that indicate fake news.
- Provide a simple function for real-time news classification.


### DATA SET
The dataset used in this project consists of two CSV files:
   - Fake.csv â€“ Contains text from fake news articles labeled as 1.
   - True.csv â€“ Contains text from real news articles labeled as 0.

The dataset is shuffled and split into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets. The text data is preprocessed to remove unnecessary symbols, links, and punctuation.

The model effectively identifies key indicators of fake news and provides high accuracy with a simple yet efficient approach. Future improvements could involve deep learning models such as LSTMs or transformers to enhance accuracy and handle complex linguistic patterns.







## CREDIT CARD FRAUD DETECTION


### ABSTRACT
Credit card fraud detection is a critical challenge in financial security. This project applies machine learning techniques to detect fraudulent transactions using a Random Forest Classifier. The dataset is analyzed through data preprocessing, feature engineering, and classification modeling. The performance is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and a confusion matrix.

This project processes and classifies credit card transactions as fraudulent or valid. The steps include:

1.Data Exploration â€“ Analyzing transaction distributions and fraud prevalence.

2.Data Preprocessing â€“ Handling missing values, feature selection, and normalization.

3.Feature Engineering â€“ Using Principal Component Analysis (PCA)-transformed features.

4.Model Training â€“ Applying a Random Forest Classifier for classification.

5.Evaluation â€“ Measuring performance with classification metrics and visualizations.

### PROJECT GOALS
  - Build a machine learning model to classify fraudulent transactions.

  - Analyze key indicators of fraudulent behavior.

  - Improve classification performance through hyperparameter tuning.

  - Provide an interpretable and scalable fraud detection solution.

### DATASET
The dataset used is the Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset from Kaggle. It contains numerical features derived from PCA, making it suitable for anomaly detection.

   - Features: 28 anonymized numerical attributes (V1â€“V28), Time, and Amount.

   - Target Variable: Class (0 = Legitimate, 1 = Fraudulent).

   - Dataset Split: 80% Training, 20% Testing.
