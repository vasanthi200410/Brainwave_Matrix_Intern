#ABSTRACT


##The spread of fake news is a major concern in today's digital world. This project aims to build a machine learning model to classify news articles as fake or real using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The approach involves text preprocessing, feature extraction using TF-IDF, and training a Naïve Bayes classifier to make predictions. The model's performance is evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrix, and ROC curve.



#OVERVIEW

##This project processes and classifies news articles based on their authenticity. The steps include:

##1.Data Cleaning & Preprocessing (removing noise, stopwords, and formatting text)
##2.Feature Extraction (TF-IDF vectorization with bigrams)
##3.Model Training (Multinomial Naïve Bayes for text classification)
##4.Evaluation (classification metrics, feature importance analysis, and visualization)
##5.Prediction (a function to classify new text as fake or real)


#Project Goals

Develop a machine learning model to detect fake news.
Improve classification accuracy using TF-IDF and Naïve Bayes.
Analyze the most important features that indicate fake news.
Provide a simple function for real-time news classification.
