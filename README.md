# ABSTRACT

The spread of fake news is a major concern in today's digital world. This project aims to build a machine learning model to classify news articles as fake or real using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The approach involves text preprocessing, feature extraction using TF-IDF, and training a Naïve Bayes classifier to make predictions. The model's performance is evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrix, and ROC curve.



# OVERVIEW

This project classifies news articles as fake or real using machine learning. It involves data cleaning (removing noise and stopwords), feature extraction (TF-IDF with bigrams), and model training using Multinomial Naïve Bayes. The model is evaluated with classification metrics and visualizations like confusion matrices and word clouds. A prediction function allows new text to be classified, ensuring an efficient approach to detecting fake news.


# Project Goals

Develop a machine learning model to detect fake news.
Improve classification accuracy using TF-IDF and Naïve Bayes.
Analyze the most important features that indicate fake news.
Provide a simple function for real-time news classification.
