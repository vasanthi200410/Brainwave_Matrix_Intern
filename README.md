#Abstract
The spread of fake news is a major concern in today's digital world. This project aims to build a machine learning model to classify news articles as fake or real using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The approach involves text preprocessing, feature extraction using TF-IDF, and training a Na√Øve Bayes classifier to make predictions. The model's performance is evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrix, and ROC curve.
