#TASK 1
##FAKE NEWS DETECTION


### ABSTRACT

The spread of fake news is a major concern in today's digital world. This project aims to build a machine learning model to classify news articles as fake or real using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The approach involves text preprocessing, feature extraction using TF-IDF, and training a Naïve Bayes classifier to make predictions. The model's performance is evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrix, and ROC curve.



### OVERVIEW

 This project processes and classifies news articles based on their authenticity. The steps include:

- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing – Removing noise, stopwords, and formatting text.
- Feature Extraction – Applying TF-IDF vectorization with bigrams to convert text into numerical form.
- Model Training – Using Multinomial Naïve Bayes for text classification.
- Evaluation – Analyzing classification metrics, feature importance, and visualizations.
- Prediction – Implementing a function to classify new text as fake or real.


### Project Goals

- Develop a machine learning model to detect fake news.
- Improve classification accuracy using TF-IDF and Naïve Bayes.
- Analyze the most important features that indicate fake news.
- Provide a simple function for real-time news classification.


### DATA SET
The dataset used in this project consists of two CSV files:
   - Fake.csv – Contains text from fake news articles labeled as 1.
   - True.csv – Contains text from real news articles labeled as 0.

The dataset is shuffled and split into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets. The text data is preprocessed to remove unnecessary symbols, links, and punctuation.

### Algorithm

- Data Preprocessing – Cleaning text by removing punctuation, stopwords, and special characters.
- Feature Extraction – Converting text into numerical representation using TF-IDF vectorization.
- Model Selection – Training a Multinomial Naïve Bayes classifier, a probabilistic model well-suited for text classification.
- Evaluation Metrics:
    - Accuracy – Measures overall model performance.
    - Confusion Matrix – Identifies classification errors.
    - ROC Curve & AUC Score – Evaluates the model’s discrimination ability.

### Conclusion

  The implemented Naïve Bayes classifier with TF-IDF achieves promising results in detecting fake news. The model effectively identifies key indicators of fake news and provides high accuracy with a simple yet efficient approach. Future improvements could involve deep learning models such as LSTMs or transformers to enhance accuracy and handle complex linguistic patterns.
